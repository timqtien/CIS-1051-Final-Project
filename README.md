# CIS-1051-Final-Project

This project was a good way to learn python beyond the basic functions/libraries we used in class. Being able to try out packages such as pandas, numpy, and scipy was a great experience as I want to go into data anlytics/science in the future which will include using these packages a lot. The hard part about this was trying to self teach the terminology and functions within these packages in a short timeframe. If I ever struggled with using them it couldn't just go to office hours and had to go through the documentation or stack exchange for answers. Overall though, I felt that I was pretty successful in using these packages and that the final product turned out decently well considering the circumstances.
